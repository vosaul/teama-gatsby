#### About Me

I started in the IT industry and in 2014 started creating visual effects.

I always follow new technologies and try to apply them in my work.

I'm more of a technical expert who will always find a solution to a particular problem.

#### My main skills 
VR, AR, AI, compositing, beauty work, camera mapping, camera tracking and clean-up.

You can see some of the projects I've been involved in here:
