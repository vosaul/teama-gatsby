#### About Me

I have been working in the VFX industry for over 8 years. 
I mainly do compositing and 3D simulations.  

Previously, I worked at "Raketa Film" and "Gloria FX" studios, supervised over 150 successful projects. 

I constantly learn something new and try to bring something special to everything I do. 

In my free time, I ride on boards, shoot and edit extreme videos and make vlogs for YouTube channel.
