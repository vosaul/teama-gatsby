#### About Me

I worked for 5 years as a videographer. 

Since 2017, I have been working in the VFX industry. 

I mainly focus on editing, color grading, compositing and 3D modeling. 

Previously, I worked for Gloria FX. 

I try to do qualitatively everything that I do. 

I like to create with my own hands, Also I like to ride bicycles and boards.
